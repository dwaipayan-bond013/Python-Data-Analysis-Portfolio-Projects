Welcome to the **DTDC Delivery Performance Analysis** project! This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis pipeline built in Python to evaluate and optimize the delivery network of DTDC, one of India's leading logistics companies.

## Project Description

In this project, we dive deep into delivery trip data to uncover hidden inefficiencies, regional logistics trends, and route-level performance metrics. Our goal is to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions to improve delivery accuracy, reduce delays, and boost customer satisfaction.

We work with a dataset comprising **144,867+ delivery records**, including information on trip times, source-destination pairs, route types, estimated vs actual distances, and delays.

## Dataset Highlights

### Column Description:-

#### ‚Ä¢ data - tells whether the data is testing or training data

#### ‚Ä¢ route_schedule_uuid ‚Äì Unique Id for a particular route schedule
#### ‚Ä¢ route_type ‚Äì Transportation type
#### ‚Ä¢ FTL ‚Äì Full Truck Load: FTL shipments get to the destination sooner, as the truck is making no other pickups or drop-offs along the way
#### ‚Ä¢ Carting: Handling system consisting of small vehicles (carts)
#### ‚Ä¢ trip_uuid - Unique ID given to a particular trip (A trip may include different source and destination centers)
#### ‚Ä¢ source_center - Source ID of trip origin

#### ‚Ä¢ od_end_time ‚Äì Trip end time
#### ‚Ä¢ start_scan_to_end_scan ‚Äì Time taken to deliver from source to destination
#### ‚Ä¢ is_cutoff ‚Äì Boolean value indicating whether cutoff time is met or not
#### ‚Ä¢ cutoff_factor ‚Äì A derived metric or coefficient used to model or adjust delivery timelines based on how close an order is placed to the cutoff time. It often accounts for order processing delays or time-window compression
#### ‚Ä¢ cutoff_timestamp ‚Äì Cutoff Time
#### ‚Ä¢ actual_distance_to_destination ‚Äì Distance in Kms between source and destination warehouse
#### ‚Ä¢ actual_time ‚Äì Actual time taken to complete the delivery (Cumulative)
#### ‚Ä¢ osrm_time ‚Äì An open-source routing engine time calculator which computes the shortest path between points in a given map (Includes usual traffic, distance through major and minor roads) and gives the time (Cumulative)
#### ‚Ä¢ osrm_distance ‚Äì An open-source routing engine which computes the shortest path between points in a given map (Includes usual traffic, distance through major and minor roads) (Cumulative)
#### ‚Ä¢ factor ‚Äì Unknown field
#### ‚Ä¢ segment_actual_time ‚Äì This is a segment time. Time taken by the subset of the package delivery
#### ‚Ä¢ segment_osrm_time ‚Äì This is the OSRM segment time. Time taken by the subset of the package delivery
#### ‚Ä¢ segment_osrm_distance ‚Äì This is the OSRM distance. Distance covered by subset of the package delivery
#### ‚Ä¢ segment_factor ‚Äì Unknown field

- Compare actual vs OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) estimates for time and distance using EDA and A/B testing
- Analyze transport mode effectiveness (Carting vs FTL)
- Uncover regional trends in delivery traffic
- Provide actionable recommendations to improve route efficiency

## üìà Key Business Insights
1. Data Overview
   - Total Records Analyzed: 144,867 delivery segments
   - Transport Types:
     - Carting: Major mode of transport (visibly dominant across trips)
     - FTL (Full Truck Load): Used for long-haul, high-volume routes

2. Route Efficiency
   - Average OSRM(open-source routing engine) Estimated Time: ~66 minutes
   - Average Actual Time Taken: ~84 minutes
   - Delay Compared to Estimate: ~27% longer than the optimal time
   - This indicates inefficiencies in logistics (traffic, delays, handling).
   - Segment-wise Time:
      - Avg OSRM Segment Time: ~26 mins
      - Avg Actual Segment Time: ~37 mins
      - Efficiency Drop in Segment-Level: 42.3% increase

3. Distance Insights
  - Average Distance Travelled (Actual): 56.9 km
  - OSRM Estimated Distance: 62.3 km
  - Actual distances are ~8.7% shorter, suggesting some optimization in real-world routing.

4. State-wise Delivery Volume
  - Top 5 Source States:
    - Maharashtra
    - Karnataka
    - Haryana
    - Tamil Nadu
    - Uttar Pradesh

 - Top 5 Destination States:
   - Maharashtra
   - Gujarat
   - Karnataka
   - Delhi
   - Tamil Nadu

  ![](NumberofDestinationStatewise.PNG)

These states account for more than 65% of total delivery volumes.Maharashtra leads both in dispatch and receipt, indicating intra-state routing. Resource planning should factor in state-specific traffic and return load strategies.
Maharashtra and Karnataka form DTDC‚Äôs delivery heartlands.Weak penetration in northeastern states signals potential for regional growth if infrastructure allows.

5. Time Efficiency by Route Type
   - From visual comparisons:
     - FTL (Full Truck Load): Actual time is much higher than OSRM estimated time (approx. 575 vs 430)
     - FTL Deliveries are consistently closer to OSRM time predictions (deviation < 15%)
     - Carting: Lower volume but still shows actual time exceeding estimates
     - Carting Deliveries show higher deviations (avg. 20‚Äì35% longer than OSRM estimates)
     - FTL routes show more delays, possibly due to bulk handling, loading/unloading time, or highway congestion
     - Carting might be more efficient for smaller, time-sensitive loads

Recommendation: FTL should be prioritized for high-priority or long-distance deliveries.

6. Cut-off Performance
   - Cutoff Factor Average: ~2.5
   - This field  correlates with delay beyond scheduled scan windows
   - Suggests the importance of adjusting cutoff factor thresholds to manage SLA compliance better

7. Factor Analysis (Delay Ratio)
factor = actual_time / osrm_time

Mean factor: 1.31

25% of routes had factor > 1.5, i.e., delays of more than 50%

This metric is crucial in identifying underperforming routes.

8. Top City Pairs with High Volume
Anand (Gujarat) ‚ûù Khambhat (Gujarat)

Sonipat ‚ûù Gurgaon

Mumbai ‚ûù Pune

These city pairs form hot corridors. Logistics efficiency here affects overall network performance.
