Welcome to the **DTDC Delivery Performance Analysis** project! This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis pipeline built in Python to evaluate and optimize the delivery network of DTDC, one of India's leading logistics companies.

## Project Description

In this project, we dive deep into delivery trip data to uncover hidden inefficiencies, regional logistics trends, and route-level performance metrics. Our goal is to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions to improve delivery accuracy, reduce delays, and boost customer satisfaction.

We work with a dataset comprising **144,867+ delivery records**, including information on trip times, source-destination pairs, route types, estimated vs actual distances, and delays.

## Business Problem
DTDC faced challenges in understanding regional delivery performance, route inefficiencies, and delay patterns across its pan-India network. There was a lack of visibility into state-wise trip volumes, delivery delays compared to estimated timelines, and seasonal demand fluctuations. This limited the company's ability to optimize resources, maintain SLA compliance, and expand into underserved regions. Through comprehensive data analysis and visual insights, this project identifies operational bottlenecks, high-demand corridors, and delay hotspots, enabling DTDC to make data-driven decisions to enhance delivery efficiency, reduce turnaround times, and improve customer satisfaction.

     - FTL (Full Truck Load): Actual time is much higher than OSRM estimated time (approx. 575 vs 430)
     - Carting Deliveries are consistently closer to OSRM time predictions (deviation < 15%)
     - Carting: Lower volume but still shows actual time exceeding estimates
     - Carting Deliveries show higher deviations (avg. 20â€“35% longer than OSRM estimates)
     - FTL routes show more delays, possibly due to bulk handling, loading/unloading time, or highway congestion
     - Carting might be more efficient for smaller, time-sensitive loads

  ![](RoutewiseDeliveryAnalysis.PNG)

Recommendation: FTL should be prioritized for high-priority or long-distance deliveries.

6. Cut-off Performance
   - Cutoff Factor Average: ~2.5
   - This field  correlates with delay beyond scheduled scan windows
   - Suggests the importance of adjusting cutoff factor thresholds to manage SLA compliance better
