Welcome to the **DTDC Delivery Performance Analysis** project! This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis pipeline built in Python to evaluate and optimize the delivery network of DTDC, one of India's leading logistics companies.

## Project Description

In this project, we dive deep into delivery trip data to uncover hidden inefficiencies, regional logistics trends, and route-level performance metrics. Our goal is to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions to improve delivery accuracy, reduce delays, and boost customer satisfaction.

We work with a dataset comprising **144,867+ delivery records**, including information on trip times, source-destination pairs, route types, estimated vs actual distances, and delays.

## Dataset Highlights

### Column Description:-

#### â€¢ data - tells whether the data is testing or training data
#### â€¢ trip_creation_time â€“ Timestamp of trip creation
#### â€¢ route_schedule_uuid â€“ Unique Id for a particular route schedule
#### â€¢ route_type â€“ Transportation type
#### â€¢ FTL â€“ Full Truck Load: FTL shipments get to the destination sooner, as the truck is making no other pickups or drop-offs along the way
#### â€¢ Carting: Handling system consisting of small vehicles (carts)
#### â€¢ trip_uuid - Unique ID given to a particular trip (A trip may include different source and destination centers)
#### â€¢ source_center - Source ID of trip origin
#### â€¢ source_name - Source Name of trip origin
#### â€¢ destination_cente â€“ Destination ID
#### â€¢ destination_name â€“ Destination Name
#### â€¢ od_start_time â€“ Trip start time
#### â€¢ od_end_time â€“ Trip end time
#### â€¢ start_scan_to_end_scan â€“ Time taken to deliver from source to destination
#### â€¢ is_cutoff â€“ Unknown field
#### â€¢ cutoff_factor â€“ Unknown field
#### â€¢ cutoff_timestamp â€“ Unknown field
#### â€¢ actual_distance_to_destination â€“ Distance in Kms between source and destination warehouse
#### â€¢ actual_time â€“ Actual time taken to complete the delivery (Cumulative)
#### â€¢ osrm_time â€“ An open-source routing engine time calculator which computes the shortest path between points in a given map (Includes usual traffic, distance through major and minor roads) and gives the time (Cumulative)
#### â€¢ osrm_distance â€“ An open-source routing engine which computes the shortest path between points in a given map (Includes usual traffic, distance through major and minor roads) (Cumulative)
#### â€¢ factor â€“ Unknown field
#### â€¢ segment_actual_time â€“ This is a segment time. Time taken by the subset of the package delivery
#### â€¢ segment_osrm_time â€“ This is the OSRM segment time. Time taken by the subset of the package delivery
#### â€¢ segment_osrm_distance â€“ This is the OSRM distance. Distance covered by subset of the package delivery
#### â€¢ segment_factor â€“ Unknown field

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Objectives

- Explore patterns in delivery delays and identify high-risk routes.
- Compare actual vs OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) estimates for time and distance using EDA and A/B testing.
- Analyze transport mode effectiveness (Carting vs FTL).
- Uncover regional trends in delivery traffic.
- Provide actionable recommendations to improve route efficiency.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas, NumPy** â€“ Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** â€“ Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ Exploratory analysis and documentation

## ðŸ“Š Visual Insights

Key insights are visualized through bar plots, box plots, heatmaps, and scatter plots to simplify interpretation and storytelling.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Outcomes

- Identified top 5 high-volume delivery states and cities
- Found that actual deliveries take **27% longer** on average than OSRM estimates
- Determined **FTL is more time-efficient** compared to Carting
- Highlighted critical city-pairs and underperforming segments

## ðŸ§  Conclusion

This analysis serves as a foundation for improving DTDCâ€™s logistics operations using historical data and smart visual analytics. It can be extended to support real-time routing systems or SLA compliance monitoring frameworks.
